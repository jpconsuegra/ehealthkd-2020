# Previous edition of the task

The eHealth-KD 2020 challenge is an enhanced version of the [TASS 2018 Task 3: eHealth Knowledge Discovery challenge](http://www.sepln.org/workshops/tass/2018/task-3/). In this new version, additional semantic types for key phrases and relations have been included, to cover a larger portion of the semantics of a sentence. These modifications increase the complexity of the task since a larger number of classes need to be predicted. However, we believe that these modifications provided higher semantic coverage.

Inspired by the successful participation of 6 teams in the previous version, and the insightful recommendations that many of the participants provided, we have redesigned this yearâ€™s task to be both more challenging and more objectively evaluated. Hence, we divided the evaluation scenarios so that each specific Subtask is evaluated independently, and also provide a scenario for evaluating the complete pipeline. We also merged previous year's Subtasks A and B since they are very similar in nature and complexity.
